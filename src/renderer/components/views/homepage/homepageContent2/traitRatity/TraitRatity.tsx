        <p>
          All apes are equal, but some apes are more equal than others. That’s
          why we’ve established a trait rarity system to tell which of our
          students are likely destined for greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 137 total traits in the academy and these have been
          categorized into a tier based system {window.screen.width < 992 ? "" : "(seen on the right)"}. Traits are
          ranked from ‘common’ all the way through to ‘mythic’ and each rank has
          a corresponding % chance of being minted. All of the Academy’s traits
          and their rarity % can be viewed over in our ‘traits’ section. Click
          below to check them out.
